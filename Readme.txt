## ðŸ“Š Analysis Workflow

### **1. Data Cleaning**
- Removed NULL and zero-valued records in important fields
- Fixed encoding issues (BOM in column names)
- Corrected price values stored in paise instead of rupees
- Recalculated discount percentages
- Checked for inconsistent pricing (`DISCOUNTEDSELLINGPRICE > MRP`)

### **2. Data Exploration**
- Identified distinct product categories
- Counted in-stock vs out-of-stock products
- Detected duplicate product names

### **3. Business Insights**
- **Top discounted products** â†’ Which products have the highest markdowns
- **Out-of-stock analysis** â†’ Categories most often unavailable
- **High-value out-of-stock items** â†’ Expensive items missing from inventory
- **Stockout risk prediction** â†’ Based on quantity & discount level
- **Revenue estimation** â†’ Total estimated revenue by category
- **Price per gram** â†’ Value-for-money analysis for products > 100g
- **Weight categorization** â†’ Small, medium, bulk product classification

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
1. **High Discount â†’ Low Stock**  
   Products with large discounts often have lower availability, suggesting strong demand.
2. **Certain Categories Dominate Revenue**  
   Some categories consistently bring in more revenue per unit.
3. **Premium Out-of-Stock Items**  
   Expensive products going out of stock represent missed sales opportunities.
4. **Discounts Likely Boost Turnover**  
   Categories with higher discounts tend to have fewer available units.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. **Import Dataset**  
   - Place `zepto_v2.csv` in MySQL database
   - Table name: `ZEPTO_V2`

2. **Run SQL Script**  
   - Execute queries in `ZEPTO_V2_Cleaning_Analysis.sql` step-by-step
   - Queries are grouped into:
     - Data Cleaning
     - Data Exploration
     - Business Insights

3. **Interpret Results**  
   - Use output tables to guide business decisions
   - Modify thresholds for stockout risk based on your needs

## ðŸ“Œ Example Queries

### **Top 10 Discounted Products**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT NAME, Category, MRP, DISCOUNTPERCENT
FROM ZEPTO_V2
ORDER BY DISCOUNTPERCENT DESC
LIMIT 10;
